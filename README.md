# lemonbar-status

## Description

`lemonbar-status` outputs the system status on standard output.

The program does not take any command line arguments and does not
use a configuration file. To change its behavior its source code
must be changed and recompiled.

The information displayed includes

* the current title played by the Music Player Daemon,
* the mail status,
* the active network interface name and the IP address,
* the battery status,
* the display brightness,
* the audio volume,
* the current weather and
* the current date and time.

The display is updated periodically with an interval of 10
seconds. If possible, events generated by the system are
intercepted and the information is updated immediately.

## Prerequisites

### Compilation

To compile the program you presumably must be running OpenBSD
(tested on version 6.2), you have a recent X server installation
and the json-c library is installed.

### Runtime

The following conditions must be met for running the
`lemonbar-status`.

* You are running OpenBSD.
* Your username is `wilfried`
* You are running the `mpd` music player daemon.
* Your are using `trunk0` as your network connection
* Your audio system has an `outputs.master` and an
  `outputs.master.mute` mixer device.
* My `weather` script is installed anywhere in `$PATH` and
  executable. It must output its data to
  `$HOME/.config/weather/`.

If one of these conditions is not met, the program will either
not start up or the corresponding output will be disabled.
